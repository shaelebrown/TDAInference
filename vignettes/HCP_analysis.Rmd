# Introduction

The human brain is a complex dynamical system which encodes and processes its outside environment to drive behavioral decisions. A popular technology for studying the function of the brain, i.e. how it encodes and processes its environment, is called functional MRI (fMRI). fMRI has the ability to image the whole brain, where the intensity of each voxel (i.e. 3D volumetric pixel) is a proxy measure of the "activity" of that small volumetric brain region, over multiple time points giving both spatial and temporal information about brain activity. A common method for analyzing fMRI data is computing correlation matrices, which can either be spatial (correlating the vectors of activity, called spatial activity patterns, at different time points) or temporal (correlating the time courses of brain regions, called temporal functional connectivity (FC)).

```{r,echo = F,eval = T,fig.height = 4,fig.width = 4,fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("spatial_correlation.jpg")
```

```{r,echo = F,eval = T,fig.height = 4,fig.width = 4,fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("temporal_FC.jpg")
```

In fMRI studies, data is collected from subjects who are either performing some task (for instance repeatedly viewing pictures from various object categories [@RSA]) or relaxing (fixating at the center of a screen, called "resting state"). This allows researchers to make inferences about which brain regions are responsible for which types of tasks or processes, making it an important tool for studying the brain. Moreover, fMRI (and other similar technologies) have become a popular venue for topological data analysis.

Topological data analysis has become a powerful tool for analyzing fMRI data due to persistent homology's ability to detect topological signal in fMRI data [@topological_feasibility;@cohomology_feasability] and model high-dimensional communication between multiple brain regions, all without needing to choose an arbitrary threshold for "significant" correlations in FC [@importance_of_the_whole;@twos_company;@persistent_hom_brain_networks;@TDA_ADHD]. In these kinds of studies, persistent homology (or closely related tools) has mainly been used to find the topology of temporal FC. However, such approaches can remove much temporal information in the data, and another topological data analysis tool called mapper [@mapper] has analyzed spatial correlation matrices to find structure in fMRI spatial activity patterns [@BrainOrganizationMapper]. However, unlike persistent homology, mapper is not designed to find periodic structures in data, which in fMRI data may encode essential periodic patterns in temporal brain activity. Therefore, we will use persistent homology and TDApplied to perform an **exploratory** topological analysis of the **loops** found in spatial correlation matrices in data from one of the most important sources of high-quality neuroimaging data - the Human Connectome Project [@HCP]. 

The Human Connectome Project contains extensively preprocessed neuroimaging data from about 1200 subjects, allowing researchers to make powerful inferences about the function of the human brain. Of the data collected, fMRI was used to record brain activity over time while participants completed 9 tasks. The tasks were two resting-state scans, an emotion, gambling, language, working memory, relational, social and motor task, and for each task there were two scans (resulting in 18 scans per subject). The HCP fMRI data was also processed to convert voxels into surface nodes - points, on a mesh of the brain's surface geometry, which are comparable across subjects. The resting state scans were longer than the other task scans, which normally necessitates the use of analysis methods which abstract out temporal information (like temporal FC). However, by using topology we can interrogate the geometry of the spatial activity patterns, which we call *mental state topology*, without losing potentially task-related temporal information. It was found that that mental state topologies in the HCP dataset contained robust 0-dimensional topological features which correlated with various measures of personality and behavior [@topological_time_and_space]. On the other hand, temporal FC can act as a "fingerprint" for identifying subjects in the HCP dataset [@functional_fingerprinting]. So what role can loops of mental-state topology play in distinguishing between subjects and tasks in the HCP dataset?

To answer this question we analyzed 100 HCP subject's fMRI data with TDApplied by

1. calculating time-point by time-point correlation distance matrices of each fMRI dataset for each subject (normalizing the activity vector of each time point and transforming correlations $\rho$ into distances $\sqrt{2*(1-\rho)}$, see the appendix for an explanation),
2. computing thresholded persistence diagrams of dimension 1 from those dissimilarity matrices (using the bootstrap method), and 
3. using machine learning and inference functions from TDApplied to analyze the resulting collection of diagrams.

The script used to generate these results, as well as the subject ID's used, can be found in the exec directory of the package. Since the persistence Fisher kernel takes two parameters, $t$ and $\sigma$, we chose a grid over both parameters to perform the independence tests. In the paper [@persistence_fisher], the $\sigma$ values $10^{\{-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3\}}$ were used for an SVM task. Since our input data had maximum value 1 (due to normalization) we will use the values $10^{\{-3,-2,-1\}} = \{0.001,0.01,0.1\}$. Also in that paper, values of $t$ were selected by taking the 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 percentile values of the Fisher information metric between all of the diagrams (for each value of $\sigma$), and we used the same procedure to select values of $t$ (after subsetting for only positive values). The parameters that resulted from this process are stored in the file `kernel_parameters.csv` in the vignette directory of the package.

# Visualizing mental state topologies

What does a mental state topology, or a collection of them, represent? Loops in a mental state topology are sets of spatially periodic patterns of spatial activity, and these sets vary along one neurological dimension of activity. Collections of mental state topologies, like combining all of the persistence diagrams from the resting state 1 task across all 100 subjects, could encode both a characteristic number and representative neurological dimensions of loops across the whole collection. In this section we visualize combined diagrams across subjects and tasks, and construct representative loops from all the resting state 1 mental state topologies.

We visualized the persistence diagrams of subjects and tasks by combining all the diagrams for that subjects/task and plotting a probability distribution induced by adding a Gaussian point mass centered at each point (like in the Fisher information metric) with $\sigma$ values 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1. Plots with $\sigma = 0.1$ and $\sigma = 0.001$ were least informative because $\sigma$ was comparable to the scale of the data or too fine scale respectively. Here are the distribution plots for three subjects with $\sigma = 0.001$:

```{r,echo = F,eval = T,fig.height = 3,fig.width = 9,fig.align = 'center'}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
visualize_diagram <- function(diag,sigma,plot_title,lim = NULL){

visualize_diagram(s105620,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Subject 105620",lim = lim_subj)

visualize_diagram(s118023,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Subject 118023",lim = lim_subj)
```

As we can see the distributions were very different between these three subjects. Next we visualized the nine tasks (again with $\sigma = 0.01$):

```{r,echo = F,eval = T,fig.height = 9,fig.width = 9,fig.align = 'center'}
par(mfrow = c(3,3))
visualize_diagram(rest1,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Resting state 1",lim = lim_task)
visualize_diagram(rest2,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Resting state 2",lim = lim_task)
visualize_diagram(emotion,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Emotion",lim = lim_task)
visualize_diagram(gambling,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Gambling",lim = lim_task)
visualize_diagram(language,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Language",lim = lim_task)
visualize_diagram(motor,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Motor",lim = lim_task)
visualize_diagram(relational,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Relational",lim = lim_task)
visualize_diagram(social,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Social",lim = lim_task)
visualize_diagram(wm,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Working memory",lim = lim_task)
```

Again we found that the tasks had visually different distributions, although the two resting state scans are fairly similar, as we would expect, with two nearby clusters of loops. 

But what do these mental state loops represent in terms of brain activity? As an illustration we considered the resting state 1 persistence diagram and used kmeans clustering to find two "basis" resting state 1 loops which described all of the loops well:

```{r,echo = F,eval = T,fig.height = 4,fig.width = 4,fig.align = 'center'}
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
visualize_diagram(rest1,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Resting state 1 with one main loop")
points(x = c(mean(rest1[,2])),y = c(mean(rest1[,3])),pch = 19)
```

This loop was from one subject's resting state 1 data, but note that topologically similar loops (in terms of birth and death values) may lie in different parts of the data (i.e. represent different loops of spatial activity patterns). We calculated the representative cycle of this loops, used `cmdscale` to project the representative into 2D and selected a top, bottom, left and right points along the loops (in red): 

```{r,echo = F,eval = T,fig.height = 4,fig.width = 4,fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("loop_scatter.jpg")
```

Since the highlighted points from the plot each represent a spatial pattern of neural activity at some time point, we then plotted these spatial patterns around the circumference of a circle (however, the loop did not form a perfect circle in the data). Note that when the two brain hemispheres (i.e. sides) are plotted side-by-side, the left hemisphere is on the right and the right hemisphere is on the left. Prior to plotting, the fMRI data was first normalized to have temporal mean 0 and standard deviation 1 for each surface node. The spatial patterns were then smoothed by averaging spatial signal within a 5mm radius from each surface node, and the smoothed signal was thresholded by absolute value at least 0.75. We plotted the spatial patterns with boxes around areas which appeared to exhibit periodic behavior around the loop:

```{r,echo = F,eval = T,fig.height = 4,fig.width = 4,fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("loop.jpg")
```

We compared the locations of periodic activity (in the boxes) to a well-known parcellation of the brain into 7 resting-state networks [@rs_networks]:

```{r,echo = F,eval = T,fig.align = 'center',out.width="80%", out.height="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("parcellation.jpg")
```

The periodic behavior in the boxes appeared mainly in the activation of the ventral attention network (high activity on top and right, lower activity on bottom and left), and thus one resting-state network could be used to represent the structure of this subject's data. Therefore, it is possible that not all of the seven resting-state networks may be needed to describe the group-level resting-state data.

Coming up with techniques for determining what the one circular dimension of one such loop represents in terms of neural activity, and determining if this dimension is correlated with time/study design (i.e. the temporal sequence of events in the task) for resting-state/task-based fMRI is left to future work.

# Comparing subjects and tasks with inference

Some major functions of healthy human brains are conserved across people, but there is still much inter-subject variability (different people can respond differently to viewing the same image). But are task-induced mental state topologies conserved across subjects or tasks? To answer this question we first analyzed distributional properties of the persistence diagrams between subjects and between tasks, and compared the diagrams between subjects and between tasks using TDApplied's permutation and independence tests.

We first analyzed basic properties of the persistence diagrams - the number of loops and the mean persistence of loops, both across subjects and tasks. The overall distribution of the number of loops across all diagrams was:

```{r,echo = F,eval = T,fig.height = 4,fig.width = 4,fig.align = 'center'}
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
num_loops = c(1335,384,51,18,8,2,2)
names(num_loops) = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6)
barplot(num_loops,xlab = "Number of significant loops in the diagram")
```

The bootstrap thresholding was evidently very conservative, with about 74\% of the diagrams containing no loops. This is not to say that those diagrams were topologically trivial - on the contrary they may have contained non-trivial higher-dimensional topological structure, or it is possible that task-correlated loops may exist at smaller (i.e. less persistent) scales. To assess the validity of either explanation we would require significantly more computational resources than what was available at the time of writing, and we leave this to future work. 

We may draw two important conclusions from this graphic. Firstly, the fact that many diagrams did not have any loops provides evidence that topological structure was not driven by physiological sources, such as heart-rate and breathing, which is known to drive signal in fMRI data [@Denoising]. Secondly, resting-state analyses are often concerned with the activity of (about) seven major "resting-state networks" found in [@rs_networks], and task analyses often study the activity of a similar numbers of task-specific networks. However, our loop analysis found that fewer loop dimensions (perhaps up to 1 loop) were needed to describe the HCP data, suggesting high-dimensional topological features may be a useful low-dimensional representation of spatial fMRI data.

We then compared the distribution of the number of loops across subjects and tasks using paired t-tests (with two-sided alternative hypotheses and at the $\alpha = 0.05$ threshold for type 1 error). About 22\% of the subject-subject pairs had statistically different numbers of loops, and about 28\% of the task-task pairs had statistically significant numbers of loops. Interestingly, half of the differences between tasks were found between resting state scans and task scans, with more loops in the resting state scans, suggesting that tasks may induce small-scale specialized cycles of mental states which are used to accomplish the task.

Next we performed the same analysis for the mean persistence of loops in the diagrams. About 19\% of the subject-subject pairs had differences in mean persistence values. We found 31\% statistically different persistence between tasks, mainly being higher persistence in resting state scans compared to task-based scans.

In order to better understand subject-subject and task-task differences we used TDApplied's permutation test to compare subjects (matched by task) and tasks with both the 2-wasserstein and bottleneck distances, again judging significance at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level. For the subjects, both bottleneck and wasserstein distances found about 24\% of the subject-subject pairs to have different topologies, with about 94\% of the differences conserved between the two metrics. For the tasks, in the bottleneck tests there were 12 pairs of different tasks, seven of which between one of the resting state scans with another task, and for the wasserstein tests there were only two pairs of different tasks (resting state 2 with emotional and relational), but the two resting state scans were not different from each other in any case. Therefore, the resting state scans were more different from task scans than the task scans were with each other. 

Finally, we analyzed whether any of the subject-subject or task-task pairs were independent (again at the $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level). Only about 27% of the subject-subject pairs were significantly non-independent in at least 50\% of kernel parameters - an interesting future question would be to determine whether these non-independent pairs were blood-related. On the other hand, over 89\% of the task-task pairs were found to be significantly non-independent in at least half of the kernel parameter values. Therefore, task-induced mental state topology may be strongly related between tasks - i.e. computational strategies in different neural domains may be related. In order to compare the results of the two inference procedures, we used two-sided t-tests to compare the percentage of those kernel values which found significant non-independence between subject-subject pairs who were significantly different in the permutation tests compared to pairs of subjects who were not significantly different in the tests (for both distance metrics). The results were very similar for both distance metrics, with significantly lower percentage of non-independence in non-different subject-subject pairs.

# Machine learning

Our inference analyses revealed some of the underlying topological differences of rest and task-induced neural function in the HCP dataset. However, what is the overall structure of the space of all the diagrams? In this section we will first cluster the diagrams to find distinct mental-state topological "modes", and then visualize the clusters using 2D MDS computed with both the bottleneck and wasserstein metrics.

Using all of the kernel parameters deduced earlier, we performed kernel kmeans clustering on all the persistence diagrams over a range of values of k - 2,3,4,...,18,25,50,100. These values were chosen because there were 18 scans per subject and 100 subjects. The within-cluster sum of squared (withinss) distances were calculated for each value of k and for each kernel parameter combination, and the value of k which minimized the withinss (without resulting in empty clusters) was selected as being optimal for each kernel parameter. The frequency of each number of optimal clusters was:

```{r,echo = F,fig.height = 4,fig.width = 4,fig.align = 'center'}
num_clusters <- c(14,13,12,10,2,2,1)
names(num_clusters) <- c(2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
num_clusters <- c(rep(2,14),rep(3,13),rep(4,12),rep(5,10),rep(6,2),rep(7,2),rep(8,1))

barplot(table(num_clusters),xlab = "Optimal number of clusters",main = "")
```

From the graph it seemed like the optimal number of clusters was between 2 and 5. We therefore performed clustering with all those values of k for all kernel parameters, and calculated a membership percentage matrix for each value of k - for what percentage of kernel parameters was each pair of subjects in the same cluster. For each value of k we computed the percentage of pairs of subject who were in the same cluster at least 90\% of the time, and the percent which were in the same cluster at most 5\% of the time - when k was two these percentages were 61\% and 37\%, when k was 3 they were 55\% and 36\%, for k equals 4 55\% and 37\%, and for k equals 5 0\% and 38\% (about 55\% were in the same cluster over 50\% of the time). These results indicate that the clusterings for k being 2, 3 and 4 were highly consistent across all kernel parameters. We then used the kernlab function `kkmeans` to cluster the three membership matrices, and only for k = 2 and 3 was the clustering able to be resolved (potentially due to the membership matrix not being a real kernel matrix). However, the clustering with k = 2 just returned the empty diagrams so it was not super interesting. We therefore visualized the group of diagrams in each of the three found clusters:

```{r,echo = F,eval = T,fig.height = 3,fig.width = 9,fig.align = 'center'}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
cluster1 = read.csv("cluster1.csv")
cluster1$X = NULL

cluster2 = read.csv("cluster2.csv")
cluster2$X = NULL

cluster3 = read.csv("cluster3.csv")
cluster3$X = NULL

max_birth_clust <- max(max(cluster1$birth),max(cluster2$birth),max(cluster3$birth)) + 3*0.001

max_death_clust <- max(max(cluster1$death),max(cluster2$death),max(cluster3$death)) + 3*0.001

lim_clust <- max(c(max_birth_clust,max_death_clust))

visualize_diagram(cluster1,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Cluster 1",lim = lim_clust)
visualize_diagram(cluster2,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Cluster 2",lim = lim_clust)
visualize_diagram(cluster3,sigma = 0.01,plot_title = "Cluster 3",lim = lim_clust)
```

The three clusters are quite distinct in terms of what topological information they likely represent. For cluster one this is mainly two loops but sometimes a small or very large loop (with mean persistence in the cluster of about 0.0018), for cluster two this is one loop of variable size (mean persistence in the cluster of about 0.0011), and cluster 3 is one main loop and sometimes one additional small loop (this group only had 16 loops in it, with mean persistence about 0.0005).

Next we analyzed the number of rows in the diagrams of each cluster. The results were as follows:

```{r,echo = F}
print("Cluster 1:")
c("1" = 223,"2" = 51,"3" = 18,"4" = 8,"5" = 2,"6" = 2)

print("Cluster 2:")
c("1" = 160)

print("Cluster 3:")
c("0" = 1335,"1" = 1)
```

This confirmed that cluster 1 had more loops than the other clusters on average, that cluster 2 mainly had one loop, and that cluster three was only a few loops of low persistence (and all of the no loop diagrams).

Next we analyzed the task composition of clusters, and found the following percentages (rounded to the hundredths position and ordered by most to least rounded variance):

```{r,echo = F}
print("Cluster 1:")
c("emotion" = 0.06,"gambling" = 0.12,"language" = 0.11,"motor" = 0.10,"relational" = 0.11,"rest1" = 0.16,"rest2" = 0.14,"social" = 0.11,"wm" = 0.10)[c("rest1","rest2","emotion","gambling","social","motor","relational","language")]

print("Cluster 2:")
c("emotion" = 0.15,"gambling" = 0.18,"language" = 0.13,"motor" = 0.04,"relational" = 0.1,"rest1" = 0.04,"rest2" = 0.06,"social" = 0.14,"wm" = 0.15)[c("rest1","rest2","emotion","gambling","social","motor","relational","language")]

print("Cluster 3:")
c("emotion" = 0.12,"gambling" = 0.10,"language" = 0.11,"motor" = 0.12,"relational" = 0.11,"rest1" = 0.11,"rest2" = 0.11,"social" = 0.11,"wm" = 0.11)[c("rest1","rest2","emotion","gambling","social","motor","relational","language")]
```

Cluster 1 had much higher percentages of resting state scans compared to the other clusters. However, it also had lower percentages of emotion, gambling and social tasks than the other clusters. Clusters 2 and 3 were moreso separated by percentages of resting state 2 and motor (more in cluster 3), and gambling and social (more in cluster 2).

We then calculated 2D MDS embeddings of all the diagrams using both the wasserstein and bottleneck distances, and the cluster labels did a reasonably good job at separating the embedded points:

```{r,echo = F,eval = T,fig.height = 3,fig.width = 9,fig.align = 'center'}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))

mds_bottleneck = read.csv("mds_bottleneck.csv")
mds_bottleneck$X = NULL

mds_wass = read.csv("mds_wass.csv")
mds_wass$X = NULL

color = c("1" = "#000000","2" = "#E69F00","3" = "#0072B2")[read.csv("cluster_labels.csv")$label]
names(color) = NULL

plot(x = mds_bottleneck$V1,y = mds_bottleneck$V2,xlab = "Dim 1",ylab = "Dim 2",main = "Bottleneck MDS",col = color,pch = 19)
plot(x = mds_wass$V1,y = mds_wass$V2,xlab = "Dim 1",ylab = "Dim 2",main = "Wasserstein MDS",col = color,pch = 19)
plot(NULL ,xaxt='n',yaxt='n',bty='n',ylab='',xlab='', xlim=0:1, ylim=0:1)
graphics::legend("top", pch=19, pt.cex=3, cex=1.5, bty='n',
    legend = c("Cluster 1","Cluster 2","Cluster 3"),col = c("#000000","#E69F00","#0072B2"))
graphics::mtext("Cluster label",cex=2)
```

Behavioral measures may correlate with the mental state topologies, and therefore may be explaining some of the variance within the plots (like the 0-dimensional topological features in [@topological_time_and_space]), and this could be an interesting future analysis. Also cluster 1 seemed to be more 2 dimensional in the bottleneck embedding compared to the wasserstein embedding, and determining what factors could explain these dimensions would also be an interesting future analysis.

# Conclusion

We performed an exploratory analysis of the loops in HCP mental state topologies, and found interesting differences across subjects and tasks. Visual and statistical differences between subjects (across tasks) were found in just their loops, although higher-dimensional or more local-scale topology may need to be analyzed to be able to identify subjects based on their mental state topologies. Inter-related loops emerged across tasks, and fewer loops, compared to functional networks, were needed to describe the fMRI data. Three main signatures of loop structures existed across all subjects and tasks, suggesting largely shared functional strategies across subjects and domains, and these signatures were low dimensional in their variation. Overall our analyses point towards the utility of high (above 0) dimensional topology in finding task-related and subject-specific patterns in fMRI spatial patterns.

Nevertheless, important future directions of this exploratory analysis include 

1. seeing if higher-dimensional topological features can improve subject or task discrimination, 
2. checking if low-persistence features can distinguish between subjects or tasks by decreasing how conservative the bootstrap procedure is, 
3. developing techniques for finding representative topological features when combining multiple diagrams (like in the combined resting state 1 diagram across all subjects),
4. creating methods for finding the neurological dimension which varies periodically across a loop, and determining if temporal patterns exist in this dimension,
5. determining if HCP subjects whose mental state topologies were non-independent are blood related, and
6. correlating HCP behavioral measures with the MDS embedding coordinates of the mental state topologies to see if behavior can explain variance in mental state topologies.

# Appendix: Converting Correlations to Distances

In our analysis of HCP data we converted correlation values to correlation distance values using the formula $\rho \rightarrow \sqrt{2*(1-\rho)}$. To see why this transformation does produce distance values, let $X$ and $Y$ be two vectors (of the same length $n$) with 0 mean and unit variance. Then $\rho(X,Y) = \frac{Cov(E,Y)}{\sigma_{x}\sigma_{y}} = \frac{E[(X-0)(Y-0)]}{(1)(1)} = E[XY] = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}X_i Y_i}{n}$. The Euclidean distance of $X$ and $Y$ is therefore $d(X,Y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i-Y_i)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i^2 -2\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i Y_i} = \sqrt{n + n - 2\rho(X,Y)} = \sqrt{2n(1-\rho(X,Y))} \propto \sqrt{2(1-\rho(X,Y))}$. Therefore, since a scaled distance metric (by a positive number like $\sqrt{n}$) is also a distance metric (this is very easy to verify), the transformation $\rho \rightarrow \sqrt{2*(1-\rho)}$ indeed gives distance values.
