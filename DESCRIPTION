Description: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a suite of powerful tools 
    that can find unique non-linear structure in data. The most common TDA tool, 
    persistent homology, produces a "shape descriptor" of its input data called 
    a persistence diagram which finds holes in the dataset. This package 
    implements code from several papers which have described a permutation test 
    for groups of persistence diagrams (read Robinson & Turner (2017) 
    <doi:10.1007/s41468-017-0008-7> for the basic introduction) to be used with
    persistence diagrams computed with packages 'TDA' or 'TDAStats'.
