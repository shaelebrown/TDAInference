Description: This package aims to bridge topological data analysis with data, statistical 
    and machine learning practitioners so that more analyses may benefit from the
    power of topological data analysis. The main tool of topological data analysis is 
    persistent homology, which computes a shape descriptor of a dataset, called 
    a persistence diagram. There are three goals of this package: (1) convert persistence diagrams 
    computed using the R package TDA into a commonly-used data type for data analyses 
    (a data frame), (2) implement fast versions of both distance and kernel calculations 
    for pairs of persistence diagrams, and (3) provide scalable methods for machine learning
    and inference for persistence diagrams.
