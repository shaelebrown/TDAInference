Description: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a suite of powerful tools 
    that can find non-linear structure in data which common multivariate methods
    can miss. The most common TDA tool, persistent homology, produces a 
    "shape descriptor" of its input data called a persistence diagram which 
    finds holes in the dataset. This package implements code from several 
    papers which have described a permutation test for conducting statistical
    inferences on groups of persistence diagrams (Robinson & Turner (2017) 
    <doi:10.1007/s41468-017-0008-7> is the basic introduction) to be used with
    persistence diagrams computed with package 'TDA'.
