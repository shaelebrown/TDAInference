Description: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a suite of powerful tools 
    that can find non-linear structure in data which common multivariate methods
    can miss. The most common TDA tool, persistent homology, produces a 
    "shape descriptor" of its input data called a persistence diagram which 
    finds various dimensional holes in the dataset. This package implements 
    methods for machine learning and inference with persistence diagrams.
    The basis for these methods are distance and kernel calculations, which
    are provided in a fast native-R implementation.
