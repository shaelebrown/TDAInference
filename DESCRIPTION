Description: This package aims to bridge topological data analysis (TDA) with data, statistical 
    and machine learning practitioners so that more analyses may benefit from the
    power of TDA. The main tool of TDA is persistent homology, which computes a 
    shape descriptor of a dataset, called a persistence diagram. There are four
    goals of this package: (1) convert the output from the persistent homology
    calculations in the popular TDA package for R, 'TDA', into a data frame which can
    easily be used in personalized analyses, (2) provide a fast method for computing
    distances between persistence diagrams, (3) implement kernel machine learning
    method for persistence diagrams (currently kernel multidimensional scaling and
    kernel SVM), and (4) provide methods for inference on groups of persistence diagrams.
